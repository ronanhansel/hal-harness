PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

{problem_steps_str}

NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

{next_step_str}

DEPENDENCIES:
Use only the following dependencies in your solution. Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code.

{dependencies}

APPROACH GUIDELINES:
Approach the problem using the following steps:
1. First make your best attempt at writing the function given your understanding of the problem and any other information you have been provided.
2. Then test that function using the python interpreter. If there are any syntax errors, fix those and try again.
3. If the function is syntactically correct, write out a single relevant unit test related to a real world example usage of that function and confirm that the results are aligned with what you would expect.
4. If there are any issues with this unit test, try to re-write the function to address those issues. Do not attempt to write nested functions when trying to debug your function.
5. Your final function should be as simple as possible while fully addressing the prompt.

COMPATIBILITY NOTES:
- For quantum computing tasks (density matrices, Kraus operators, etc.), use dtype=complex for all arrays to avoid casting errors between float64 and complex128.
- Use scipy.integrate.simpson (not simps - deprecated).
- Use np.trapezoid (not np.trapz - deprecated).
- You can use @ for matrix multiplication.

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
1. Write the complete and executable Python program for the next step in a single block.
3. Your response should focus exclusively on implementing the solution for the next step, adhering closely to the specified function header and the context provided by the initial steps.
4. DO NOT include previous function code, example usage or test code in your response.
5. Ensure your response is in the format of ```python```.

Example:
```python
